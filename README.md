# OLTP-Project
This is a Online Transaction Processing project about Alumni Network

## Description
A University decided to automate its managment of its alumni. The system has to answer the following questions:
* Given the major, we want to know their affiliation number of the University and their address of every student that studied that major.
* Given the name of a business and the name of one of its branches, we want to know the name of the students that are currently working or worked on this branch.
